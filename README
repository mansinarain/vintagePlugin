This is a firebox browser extension to apply image effects on any image on the internet and to share that image with a click of a button.
As my friend said -- "It is like instagram on steroids!!".

You can hover over any image on the internet and apply effects such as Sepia,Vignette,Retro,Greyscale and watch the image change in front of your eyes!
Right on the page. 

It helps the user get rid of all the intermediate steps such as downloading the image, uploading it on the app to manipulate with the image
and then later uploading it back again.
